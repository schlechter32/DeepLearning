\textbullet Element notation (element of vector): $ [x_i = \underline{a} + \underline{b}]_i$

\textbullet Signal processing is not a subset of ML or the other way around, they are identical in the task \\
\textbullet Basic difference is in how to design the processing rule \\
\textbullet Regression means to calculate (SP,ML) a continuous-valued output in the real numbers from a signal, can be one-dimensional \\
\textbullet Classification means to calculate (SP,ML) a discrete-valued output from the natural numbers \\
\textbullet p. 1-5 filter in the middle is the view of a pixel and its 8 neighbours \\

\textbullet over-fitting just memorizes the training set so test set is needed \\
\textbullet testerrorrate is similar to training error rate $\rightarrow$ no over-fitting \\
\textbullet Test set and training set need to be disjuct concatenated \\
\textbullet TODO: Summary supervised learning and unsupervised learning
\section{What is deep learning?}

\textbullet feature extraction: a feature is a clustered subset of information for recognition \\
\textbullet fish example: fish length, color etc. \\
\qquad \textbullet Needs human experience, can't be calculated \\
\qquad \textbullet DNN solves the problem without feature extraction
\subsection{What is a neural network (NN)}

\textbullet Cascaded pipeline of layers \\
